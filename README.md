## Welcome to "Let me secure that for you!"

Virtual Patching is a great technique for quickly patching security vulnerabilities or weaknesses in your website, without having to touch the web server!

A virtual patching layer can sit in front of your web server, acting as a reverse proxy in front of the application. If any vulnerabilities or weaknesses are discovered by penetration testing or attack traffic, then the virtual patching layer can neuter the effects of the attack or address the weakness.
