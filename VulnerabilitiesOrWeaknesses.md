## Vulnerabilities or Weaknesses

There are many ways that you can discover security issues that affect your website: 

* internal testing
* penetration testing
* vulnerability scanners
* a bug bounty program
* malicious activity or hacks against your site
* and a myriad of others

Regardless of how the issues are discovered, the important thing now is how you address the issues.

<dl>
<dt>Vulnerabilites</dt>
<dd>These are security flaws or bugs in the platform, server software or your application</dd>
<dt>Weaknesses</dt>
<dd>These are cases where your application is working correctly, but not demonstrating the level of security that you want</dd>
</dl>

The "Let me secure that for you!" approach advocates only virtual patching known vulnerabilities or weaknesses, in only the places where they have been discovered. This avoids blanket-blocking whole classes of traffic, and the resulting chance of false-positive blocking of legitimate traffic.
